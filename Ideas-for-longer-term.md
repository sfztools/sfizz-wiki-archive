# Ideas for longer term

## Synthesis

- Oscillator mode with FM

## Effects

- Standard effect set

- Signal flow arrangements
  (cf. `dsp_order`)

- Effects per region

## Routing

- Flexible routing : allow regions to be routed to separate sends

## Expressivity

- Metalanguage to write SFZ more easily, with less repetition.
  Consider some ideas from CamelAudio Alchemy.
  - edit several properties of an item with indenting syntax
  - load data from CSV files

## Intruments

- Import other existing sample libraries
